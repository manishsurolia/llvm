This Sample program shows how we can write a clang++ program and compile it.
I am using 'llvm-config' utility from LLVM to include header files and
libraries. 

Just included this file 'llvm/IR/Function.h' in the program to showcase the
usage of 'llvm-config' utility.

To compile this program, use below command.

[ ] clang++ -I$(llvm-config --includedir) $(llvm-config --ldflags) $(llvm-config --libs) sample.cpp
